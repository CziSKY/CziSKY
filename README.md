### Hi there 👋

Also known as CziSKY or kirraObj online, my Chinese name is 「李顺顺」. I'm currently a freshman studying at Huanghe Science & Technology College (HSTC).

I have a solid understanding of Kotlin, Java, Python, a little bit familer with JavaScript / Go, and I have also touched upon Haskell and Lisp (Scheme); I am very interested in functional programming and Programming Language Theory (PLT). I'm currently working remotely full-time for an AI startup. Before this, I spent a year working full-time at a gaming company based in Xiamen.

```coq
Definition Identity {K : Set} (k : K) := k.
