### Hi there 👋

Also known as CziSKY or kirraObj online, my Chinese name is 「李顺顺」. I'm currently a freshman studying at Huanghe Science & Technology College (HSTC).

I have a solid understanding of Kotlin, Java, Python, and JavaScript, and I have also touched upon Haskell and Lisp (Scheme); I am very interested in functional programming and Programming Language Theory (PLT). I'm currently working remotely full-time for an AI startup. Before this, I spent a year working full-time at a gaming company based in Xiamen.

I consider myself to be a "jack of all trades" when it comes to Computer Science. This means I have a passion for learning and curiosity about all areas within the field, and I'm motivated to broaden my understanding further. I'm always excited to dig into new challenges and expand my horizons.
